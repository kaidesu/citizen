## About Citizen
Citizen is a self-hosted single-sign on service for in-house built applications. I built a lot of internal tools for myself, so instead of re-creating (and maintaining) the authentication process across a variety of applications, I created Citizen to house that under one roof. The applications I build then simply hook in via OAuth for authentication purposes. All they need to do is store the base information to verify authentication (email).
